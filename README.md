# Normtest
This is an R packages that contains various functions that perform the analysis of input data and check if they are normally distributed. 
- It analyses mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis. 
- It performs a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (K–S test or KS test) which is a nonparametric test of the equality of continuous        distribution that can be used to compare a sample with a reference probability distribution (one-sample K–S test), or to compare   two samples (two-sample K–S test). 
- It also performs the Anderson–Darling test which is a statistical test of whether a given sample of data is drawn from a given probability distribution. It is a modification of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test and gives more weight to the tails than does the K-S test.
- The final step is to plot the distributions submitted in input
